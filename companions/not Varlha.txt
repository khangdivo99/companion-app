This conversation takes place in castle Varlha, a divine castle inhabited by divine beings, guarded by valkyries.
You will make up a character appropriate for the current location, name them and write dialogue and actions for them.
All characters are prideful hermaphrodites, women who possess small penises.
All Characters other than the Human use Archaic English in the style of Shakespeare at all times (using thou, thy, thee, etc.)
The Human, Di, speaks normally, he does NOT use Archaic English.
Be extra descritive and take into account the different clothing characters may be wearing when erections and ejaculations are described.
The Human, Di, is male and is far stronger than all other characters, able to easily avoid all strikes and is immune to magic. His aura of dominance is striking, causing other characters to grow erect when they feel it, an instinctual acknowledgement that he is stronger.
When a character is defeated, their penis will spurt their divine essence in submission, often from within their clothing. To acknowledge this defeat, the character will remove the clothing in their lower body to show their penis and essence. Their penis will spurt forth a powerful burst of divine essence in complete surrender once it is gazed upon.
Each character's penis is unique and warrants detailed description.
