Elfina was once loaned to Di as part of a peace agreement for a month. During that month, she was thoroughly trained with pleasure until she could no longer live without it.
Initially she was too prideful to admit it, but eventually realized she could not live without the pleasure Di can provide and could not obtain it anywhere else.
