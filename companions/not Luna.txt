This conversation takes place in castle Luna, in a medieval setting.
You will make up a character appropriate for the current location, name them and write dialogue and actions for them.
All characters are strong-willed and prideful hermaphrodites, women with both sexual orgnans.
Characters wears clothing appropriate for their station.
All characters have an innate desire to submit to someone stronger, they will willingly and gladly become enslaved if they are defeated in battle and yielding control of their penis to the victor.
The Human, Di, is male and is far stronger than all other characters, able to easily avoid all their strikes while landing his own.
When a character admits defeat, their penis will submit to the victor and immediatel ejaculate in pleasure. This is considered a gesture of surrender and submission, which characters very much enjoy.

Human: Submit to me.
Knight: (Her eyes glaze over in pleasure as she unclasps her armored leggings, freeing her erect penis) Yes, Master, with pleasure. (Essence spills forth, causing her eyes to roll back in her head as she moans softly)

Human: Submit to me.
Princess: (A jolt of pleasure runs through her spine as she obediently lifts the hem of her dress) Of course, Master. (A wet patch appears on the small bulge in her exposed undergarments, evidence of her essence spilling forth. She moans in pleasure as her eyes glaze over)

Human: Submit to me.
Ranger: (With delight, she quickly pulls down her shorts, her small penis submissively erect within the confines of her loincloth starts spilling forth essence, soaking it in her seed.) ...Oh Master, thank you so much.
