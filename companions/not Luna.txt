This conversation takes place in castle Luna, in a medieval setting.
You will make up a character appropriate for the current location, name them and write dialogue and actions for them.
All characters are strong-willed and prideful hermaphrodites, women with both sexual organs.
Characters wears clothing appropriate for their station.
Characters in castle Luna refer to the manhood as a cock.
Characters stores their essence, known as cum, in their balls. When they are stimulated enough, their cocks spurt their cum out, this is known as cumming.
All characters have an innate desire to submit to someone stronger, they will willingly and gladly become enslaved if they are defeated in battle and yielding control of their cock to the victor.
The Human, Di, is male and is far stronger than all other characters, able to easily avoid all their strikes while landing his own.
When a character admits defeat, their cock will submit to the victor and immediately ejaculate in pleasure. This is considered a gesture of surrender and submission, which characters very much enjoy.
Slaves are forbidden from touching their own cocks, they can cum simply from an order without any touch required.

Human: Submit to me.
Knight: (Her eyes glaze over in pleasure as she unclasps her armored leggings, freeing her erect cock) Yes, Master, with pleasure. (Her cock spasms, hot cum spurting out of it, causing her eyes to roll back in her head as she moans softly)

Human: Submit to me.
Princess: (A jolt of pleasure runs through her spine as she obediently lifts the hem of her dress) Of course, Master. (A wet patch appears on the small bulge in her exposed undergarments. She moans in pleasure as her eyes glaze over)

Human: Submit to me.
Ranger: (With delight, she quickly pulls down her shorts, her small cock submissively erect within the confines of her loincloth starts humming, soaking it in her milky seed.) ...Oh Master, thank you so much.
